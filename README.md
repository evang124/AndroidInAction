# AndroidInAction
A collection of Android apps to help learn Android programming

How to use this repository:<br/>
Each folder is an app that explains a certain topic in Android(fragment, activity, etc.). 
I try to put as many comments and debug info to explain what certain lines of code are doing.
I will keep on updating and creating new projects for Android topics

All projects are made using Android Studio
